  This code was developed under the supervision of Professor Larry Head
  in the Systems and Industrial Engineering Department.

  Revision History:
  1. This is an initial revision. This application allows to bypass the dsrc devices for testing. Do not run MsgSender and MsgReceiver while running this application.
