  Created by: Niraj Vasant Altekar

  This code was developed under the supervision of Professor Larry Head
  in the Systems and Industrial Engineering Department.

  Revision History:
  1. This is the initial revision developed for testing the RSU4.1 interface on the available RSUs and OBUs.
  -> While using this sender, verify the following
    -> IP and port of the server receiving messages from the sink dsrc device (Lines 28 and 29)
