Your new code that uses the J2735 codec api and jsoncpp api can use this directory structure and makefile template for initial development.

The makefile uses relative paths so it will most easily work by creating a directory for your new code in src/tools similar to this current one.

The paths to the codec and json includes and libraries are relative and should work given that your directory is at the same depth as this one is in the mmitts source tree.
