CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/mmitss/Documents/cda-mmitss/mmitss/src/common/MsgTransceiver/CarmaDecoderRos2/build/carma-ros2-decoder/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/mmitss/Documents/cda-mmitss/src/mmitss-ros2-transceiver/src/MsgTransceiver/CarmaDecoderRos2/build/carma-ros2-decoder where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/mmitss/Documents/cda-mmitss/mmitss/src/common/MsgTransceiver/CarmaDecoderRos2/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/mmitss/Documents/cda-mmitss/src/mmitss-ros2-transceiver/src/MsgTransceiver/CarmaDecoderRos2/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
